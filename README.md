For this experiment, 10 images of inanimate objects are going to appear on the screen. The participant must determine whether or not they see a "face" in the image.

The stimuli consist of 10 images of objects. Each stimulus is presented for half a second. The participant has to answer by pressing "Y" for yes, they do see a face, or "N" for no, they don't see a face. The participant has three seconds to answer the question before the experiment moves on.

The responses I record are the keypresses and the reaction times. I'm recording this because I want to see how the reaction times of the participant change if they do see a face.

I saved the data file into a .csv file. Each .csv file has the block number, trial number, the keypress response of each trial, and the reaction time of each trial.
