My experiment presents different images of inanimate objects. In each trial, the participant needs to determine whether or not they see a face in the images.
The stimuli consists of 10 images. Each stimulus is presented for half a second. After the image is presented, the participant must press 'Y' if they see a face, or 'N' if they don't.
I will be recording the response they made and their reaction times.
The data will be inputed into a .csv file.
